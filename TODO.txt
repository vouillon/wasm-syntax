  let x = foo

inferred types are only on the stack
inferred types: keep track of one optional constraint
   ==> mandatory constraint ==> no need to keep any other constraint

====================

- typing
- output wasm code
- validation of wasm code
- parse wasm code and output to this format

syntaxic sugar:
- i++
- for (...)  / while / do { ... } while
- switch translated to br_table?
    match (foo) {
    1 => ..,
    2 => ..,
    _ => ..
    }
- same for try/catch
    try (body) { a => br x, ..., _ => br z}
  (not sure this works well)
- When inheriting, we can omit existing fields

  type int32 : custom = { .., foo: i32 }

====

collect constraints on untyped variables while parsing

Keep strings as strings

Precedence tests (read and write text and check unchanged)

allow comma at end of block

include a file (e.g. common types, imports)

conditional compilation using attributes

Use typechecking to eliminate unnecessary type annotations
  - we know the number type for other reasons
  - the value is known to have a more precise type

Two-step inference?
  - preserve overloading of number functions
  - propagate type in all directions (simple unification / union find?)

============

ref.as_non_null (need types?)
we need to put constraints on integer/float constants and eliminate afterwards
exceptions
tuples
array.copy/fill
block types? |t1,..,t2| -> t { ... }

strings: we should probably not escape them as much as we do

desugar tuples
==============
tuple.make  ==> just push to the stack   (e1, ..., en)
local.set  ===> store actually in n variables
local.get  ===> push all to the stack
tuple.extract(local.get x,i)
    ==> if x is a variable, just load from associated variable
    ==> otherwise, if first component, drop all other components
        else store in a temp variable before
          let (_, _, x, _, _) = e;
          x

fn caml_string_equal(p1: &eq, p2: &eq) -> &eq {
  if p1 == p2 { return 1 }
  let s1 = p1 as &string;
  let s2 = p2 as &string;
  let len = array_len(s1);
  if len != array_len(s2) { return 0 }
  for (let i; i++; i <s len) {
    if unsigned(s1[i]) != unsigned(s2[i]) { return 0 }
  }
  1
}

i = ..
loop {
  if e {
    ...
    i = ...;
    br loop
  }
}
===>
for (i = ...; e; i = ...) { ... }

Track empty lines?
Two kind of comments : inline / line
Distinguish comment on its own line?

- Get all expr locations
- Sort tokens
- Attach comments

line comments are before except if there is a blank line inbetween
