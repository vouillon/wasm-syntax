- how to deal with functions returning multiple values?
  (in generated binary code)
  ==> maybe just have a destructuring let?
  note that (x, y, z) is just a sequence of instructions
    let (x,y) = (u, v) ==> u v (locat.set $y) (local.set $x)
- syntax errors
- typing
- output wasm code
- parse wasm code and output to this format
- type for 8bit/16bit values + explicit type expansion
- validation of wasm code

====

allow to put block labels at the end?

simplify parser (type use)

collect constraints on untyped variables while parsing
